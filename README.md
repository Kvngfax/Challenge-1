## Overview

The goal was to replicate the webpage with my style of approach

## My process

I Started with HTML structure and the proceeded to the CSS whereby I styled it based on the 1440px screen size first. Then I styled it for the 375px optimal screen size.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to perfectly size up the image given and how to perfectly place them.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  padding: ;
  margin: ;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn and perfect css grid and Flexbox
